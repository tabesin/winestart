### NVIDIA ENV VARIABLE OPTIONS
## FSAA: Full Scene Anti Aliasing: can be set from 1 to 5:
## off [0], 2x (2xMS) [1], 4x (4xMS) [5], 8x (4xSS, 2xMS) [9], 8x (8xMS) [10], 16x (4xSS, 4xMS) [11]
#export __GL_FSAA_MODE=0
## if set, FSAA comes 2 others variables that have to be set as follow respectively :
## To get FSAA full control: [0] [0]
## To get FSAA enhanced for application using multisample : [0] [1]
## To get FSAA controlled by nvidia-setting ignored : [1] [1]
#export __GL_FSAAAppControlled=0
#export __GL_FSAAAppEnhanced=0
## FXAA, Fast approximate antialiasing: take avantage over traditional multisampling and
## supersampling methods: (0) (1) 
#export __GL_ALLOW_FXAA_USAGE=1
## anisotropic texture filtering set : off (0), x2 (1), x4 (2), x8 (3), x16 (4)
#export __GL_LOG_MAX_ANISO=0
## synchronize vertical refresh (0), (1)
export __GL_SYNC_TO_VBLANK=1
## if libpthread is not enabled by default (ex: wine), 
## it can be force to be set with LD_PRELOAD env variable.
#export LD_PRELOAD="libpthread.so.0 libGL.so.1" __GL_THREADED_OPTIMIZATIONS=0
## Perfomance from Nvidia Settings tool can be set to gain graphic performance instead of quality
## Quality (1), Mixed (2), Perfomance (3), otherwise comment it to unset.
export __GL_OpenGLImageSettings=3
## Do not remove or edit below except if you don't use winestarter configurator.
_nvidia_1=1

### NVIDIA MISCELLENOUS OPTIONS
## VBLANK can't bet set for multi screen, set here one of them only (if needed):
#export __GL_SYNC_DISPLAY_DEVICE=""
## to set or unset X server FBConfig behaviour : unset [0], set [1]
#export __GL_SORT_FBCONFIGS=0
## updating window moves yield, can be useful when some window app have refresh issues,
## value are : normal yield (''), no yield ["NOTHING"], background ["USLEEP"]
#export __GL_YIELD=""
## allow unofficial GLX implmentation. Mostly for debug mode or test, but can be useful
## in some case like Wine : off [0], on [1]
export __GL_ALLOW_UNOFFICIAL_PROTOCOL=1
## if monitor can manage G-SYNC behaviour, this could improove display performance: off [0], on [1].
## Disable __GL_SYNC_TO_VBLANK to get faster performance and also xorg conf options "stereo", "overlays"
export __GL_GSYNC_ALLOWED=1
## ignore GLGS extension check. Could be useful in case of some missing extension in appli GL sets.
## This will permit the shaders to be successfuly recompile: to off [0], on [1]
#export __GL_IGNORE_GLSL_EXT_REQS=0
## Do not remove or edit below except if you don't use winestarter configurator.
